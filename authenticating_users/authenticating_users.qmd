# Authenticating Users

**R users require local system accounts regardless of what RStudio authentication method you use.** You must set up local system accounts manually or programmatically and then map authenticating users to these accounts.

For user identification, authentication, and authorization using local system accounts, RStudio relies heavily on Linux [Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module). PAM can be used by itself to authenticate users or along with other external authentication mechanisms (e.g., Web Single Sign-On) to authorize existing local system accounts.

::: {.callout-note}
*Not all RStudio products require local system accounts or PAM. For example, RStudio Connect and Shiny Server rely on their own authentication engines and on a single system account for doing their work in most cases, not requiring individualized development environments like the ones offered by RStudio Workbench.*

Here are the various authentication mechanisms supported by RStudio:

| Authentication                                   | RStudio Configuration                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local Accounts | [PAM Authentication] (via `pam_unix`) |
| LDAP or Active Directory | [PAM Authentication] (via `pam_sss` or `pam_ldap` in older systems) |
| Kerberos | [PAM Authentication] (via `pam_sss` or `pam_krb5` in older systems) |
| Web Single Sign-On (SSO) | [SAML Single Sign-On Authentication] or [OpenID Connect Authentication] |
| Others (client-server, e.g., RADIUS) | As supported by various [PAM modules](http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_SAG.html) |
| Others (browser-based, e.g., Kerberos [SPNEGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO) SSO) | [Proxied Authentication] |

::: {.callout-note}
SAML, OpenID, and Proxied authentication still require [PAM Sessions] to automatically create local system accounts. Without it, local system accounts have to be provisioned manually one-by-one.
