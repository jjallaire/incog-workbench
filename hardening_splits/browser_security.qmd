## Browser Security

This section summarizes the recommendations in the [Access and Security] section.

### Enable Origin Checks

To help mitigate against CSRF attacks, RStudio can automatically reject any request that originated from a domain it doesn't recognize. To enable this check, add the following configuration:

*/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf*

```ini
www-enable-origin-check=1
www-allow-origin=mysubdomain.mydomain.com
```

The `www-allow-origin` setting is optional, but is helpful when RStudio is running behind a proxy. See [Additional Security Considerations] for details.

### Disable Frame Embedding

By default, RStudio does not permit frame embedding (that is, it will not load inside another web page's `<frameset>` or `<iframe>`). No change is necessary to enforce this, but you can request it explicitly as follows:

*/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf*

```ini
www-frame-origin=none
```

### Set SameSite Cookie Header

RStudio does not set the `SameSite` cookie header by default (see [Same Site cookies] for details). We recommend setting it explicitly. 

*/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf*

```ini
www-same-site=lax
```
